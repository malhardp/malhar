I am a first year Master's student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. I completed my bachelor's for the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with Honors in Aerospace Engineering and a minor degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My primary interest is in making things fly whether they are eletric or gas powered. I am keen to work on the design and optimization of airborne bodies with the use of low-to-medium fidelity simulations. During my junior year, I got into aerodynamics of helicopter rotors and hypersonic engine inlet. After that I explored wake of wind turbines, front and rear wing of formula car, which got me even more excited. This interests motivated me to pursue higher education in Aerospace Engineering and I am looking forward to ace in the development of next-Gen aerospace vehicles.

Although I have been attracted to flying from the early life, I came to know about what intrigues me the most about flying when I took Aerodynamics course in undergrad. Following my interest, I started wokring with Prof. Dhwanil Shukla on the analysis of synchronization in multirotor micro air vehicle. This project along with Rotory Wing Aerodynamics course built strong basis for modeling, validating and analysing what I find. My skills with Python and C++ became really advanced with this project and this work of ours got published in AIAA AVIATION 2021. Following this, I indulged myself in the high-speed aerodynamics and another research project with Prof. Chatterjee got me into usage of optimization methods in ANSYS for the coming up with scramjet engine intake shape given multiple objective and constraints. 

Wind farm optimization project with multiple optimizer usage piqued my interest. Playing around with various parameters of pattern search, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing gave me insight into the power of tuning into optimization. For my bachelor's thesis, I worked on a new configuration involving multiple rotors on a single tower which enhanced the performance of conventional wind turbine. Apart from acedemics, I involved myself in IIT Bombay Racing Team for 3 years, where we design, manufacture and test electric formula race car, which goes for 0 to 100 km/s in 2.88 sec. My internship at STAR Orbitals got me into applying my optimization knowledge in the design of fairing for the first launch vehicle of the company. 

At the University of Michigan, I am working on the aerodynamic design optimization of eVTOL vehicles. I am keen to work in the design and analysis using CFD simulations and development of optimization frameworks. Whether it is conceptual or priliminary or detailed design, whether it is low or moderate fidelity, if something which involves my knowledge of modeling, simulation and optimization, I am interested in doing that.
