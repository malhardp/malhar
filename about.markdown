I am a first year Master's student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. I completed my bachelor's for the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with Honors in Aerospace Engineering and a minor degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My primary interest is in making things fly whether they are eletric or gas powered. I am keen to work on the design and optimization of airborne bodies with the use of low-to-medium fidelity simulations. During my junior year, I got into aerodynamics of helicopter rotors and hypersonic engine inlet. After that I explored wake of wind turbines, front and rear wing of formula car, which got me even more excited. This interests motivated me to pursue higher education in Aerospace Engineering and I am looking forward to ace in the development of next-Gen aerospace vehicles.
