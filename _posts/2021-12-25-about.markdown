Hi! I am a first year Master's student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. I completed my bachelor's for the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with Honors in Aerospace Engineering and a minor degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

2. Dependency of CFD Model Fidelity on Scramjet Intake Optimization
![about]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/scramjet.png)

**Description -** Simulated the hypersonic flow in ANSYS Fluent to analyze the sensitivity of objective and constraints wrt to design variables. Implemented various CFD models and conducted Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to optimize geometry. Evaluated the dependence of optimized geometry and sensitivity analysis on the fidelity of CFD models.\
**Tools Used -** ANSYS Fluent
