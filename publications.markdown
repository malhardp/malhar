## 1. Study of Synchronized Multirotor Micro Air Vehicle Aerodynamics
**Abstract - ** 
{: style="text-align: justify" }
Multi-rotor systems, such as coaxial and tandem rotors, can be regarded as a 
next-generation rotor system for full-scale helicopters as well as micro air vehicles 
(MAVs). Much research is being done to make them more efficient due to their widespread 
application from defense to drone delivery systems. Since the lower rotor operates in the 
wake of the upper rotor in both coaxial and tandem rotor configuration, its efficiency gets 
compromised. For such multi-rotor systems, synchronizing the rotor with a specific phase 
difference between them, such that the lower rotor gets minimally affected by the upper 
rotor wake, can lead to a more efficient design. A prescribed wake model was implemented
to predict the performance of synchronized and non-synchronized coaxial and tandem 
rotors. The results show a noticeable effect on the overall performance due to the 
synchronization of the rotors, especially in the case of co-rotating coaxial arrangement. 
This has an important implication that synchronizing MAV rotors could be a key to better 
efficiency and compact design\

## 2. Enhancement of the Conventional Wind Turbine Performance using Multi-rotor Configuration
**Abstract - **
{: style="text-align: justify" }
Various designs of the rotor blades, their dimensions and configurations of the 
rotors are being tested for the wind turbines in order to produce increasingly efficient and 
economically competitive energy. Rotor wake recovery effects can be leveraged in the 
multirotor wind turbines for increasing power generation in wind turbine farms. Here, 
the wake of a multirotor wind turbine is compared with a single rotor wind turbine with 
the same frontal area, tower height and tip Reynold’s number. An OpenFOAM-based 
transient RANS solver has been setup to determine the power generation of a given wind 
turbine configuration for a fixed incoming wind velocity. The preliminary results show 
that the NREL Phase VI Wind Turbine’s multirotor configuration gives a notable increase 
in power generation compared to a single rotor configuration for nearly the same thrust
force. The final paper will include a detailed analysis of the CFD results with the aim of 
studying wake interactions, wake recovery, and overall wind farm performance for 
multirotor configuration.\
